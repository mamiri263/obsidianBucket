# Obsidian bucket is an open-source mod for fabric.

This mod is mainly focused on decoration and being useless at most times but adding slight detail to the game!

### Features:

- Obsidian Bucket: The actual obsidian bucket which is crafted by using a water bucket and a lava bucket in any crafting environment.
- Molten Obsidian: This item is achieved by smelting an Obsidian Bucket in a blast furnace.(You can also obtain 9 of these by putting a Molten Obsidian Block into the crafting table.)
- Molten Obsidian Block: This item is a decoration block made by putting 9 Molten Obsidian in the crafting table.

### Installation:
- Requires the recommended Fabric Loader version for 1.20.1.
- Requires Fabric API.
- Put this mod and fabric API in your mods folder and it should work as expected.
